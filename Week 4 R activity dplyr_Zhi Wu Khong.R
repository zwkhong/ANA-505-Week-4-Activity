#Week 4: dplyr package

#Task: Write the function to get a dataset from Base R: Titanic
#and give the dataframe a new name of your choice
#(hint: you will want your data to be a dataframe. Use the function: as.data.frame(Titanic))
library(datasets)
data("Titanic")
Titanic <- as.data.frame(Titanic)

#See the top rows of the data
#TASK: Write the function to see the top rows of the data
head(Titanic,4)

#Install and call the package dplyr
#TASK: Write the functions to install and call dplyr
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

#Let's just see the Survived and Sex columns
#Task: Write the function to 'select' the Survived and Sex columns 
#(hint: use the 'select' function)
Titanic %>%
  select(Survived,Sex)

#Let's name the dataset with just the two columns, Survived and Sex
#TASK: Write the function to save the two columns as one new dataset
#and give it a name
Titanic_Sur_Sex <- Titanic %>%
  select(Survived,Sex)

#Let's get rid of the Sex column in the new dataset created above
#TASK: Write the function that deselects the sex column
#(hint: use the 'select' function to not select a -column)
Titanic_Sur_Sex %>%
  select(-Sex)

#Let's rename a column name
#TASK: Write the function that renames 'Sex' to 'Gender'
Titanic_Sur_Sex %>%
  rename(Gender = Sex)

#Let's make a new dataframe with the new column name
#TASK: Write the function that names a new dataset that includes the 'gender' column
Titanic_Sur_Sex_New <- Titanic_Sur_Sex %>%
  rename(Gender = Sex)

#Let's 'filter' just the males from our dataset
#TASK: Write the function that includes only rows that are 'male'
Titanic_Sur_Sex_New %>%
  filter(Gender == 'Male')
Titanic_Sur_Sex_Male = Titanic_Sur_Sex_New %>%
  filter(Gender == 'Male')

#Let's 'arrange' our data by gender (not the data you just filtered)
#TASK: Write the function to group the data by gender (hint: arrange())
Titanic_Sur_Sex_New %>%
  arrange(Gender)

#Let's see how many people were examined in the dataset (total the frequency in the original dataframe)
#TASK: Sum the Freq column
#TASK: After you run it, write the total here:2201
sum(Titanic$Freq)

#Since we have a males dataset, let's make a females dataset
#TASK: Write the function that includes only rows that are 'female'
Titanic_Sur_Sex_Female = Titanic_Sur_Sex_New %>%
  filter(Gender == 'Female')

#And now let's join the males and females
#TASK: Write the function that joins the male and female rows 
#(hint: try using 'union' or 'bind_rows')
bind_rows(Titanic_Sur_Sex_Male, Titanic_Sur_Sex_Female)

#Optional Task: add any of the other functions 
#you learned about from the dplyr package
Titanic %>% slice(5:10)
#Slice allows you to select the rows that you desire and you can use it to remove or duplicate the rows
#according to the documentation for dplyr package.
